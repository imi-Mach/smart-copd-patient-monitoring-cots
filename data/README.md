# smart-copd-patient-monitoring-cots
The Smart COPD patient monitoring uses this code for emulating commercial of the shelf (COTS) devices that interact with a Vue.js frontend.

## Dependencies
* Stable version of Python3 that supports GPIO modules.
* Raspberry Pi (preferablly 3 or higher).
* Operating System that works with the previous 2 dependencies (this project was tested with a linux based OS).
* Text editor to adjust code (incase the pins are not available on Raspberry Pi).
* Sensors that are compatible with Raspberry Pi (most if not all Arduino sensors should work fine).
